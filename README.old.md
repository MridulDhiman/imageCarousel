It is a 2D image slider.

Points: 
1. Use myanimelist api to get manga recommendations.
=> Ques. How to use API in react? 
=>      
2. manga carousel based on reccommendations.
=> upon hover => description show hogi (but on click pura page uske liye khulega)
3. that's it.
4. another feature could be add new images and it's description.

(Further more, save the recommendations using firebase database and authentication )
(Use react routers, to toggle between anime and manga recommendations )
